# ratethisflag

Welcome to ratethisflag!

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this repo is to build a suite of tools to enable you to rate a given flag's "coolness" based on flag design metrics outlined [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4) which are the following:

- Keep it simple.
- Use meaningful symbolism.
- Use 2-3 basic colors.
- No seals or lettering.
- Be distinctive or be related.

## Origin

This repo started out of my prepping for a short 10-minute talk on the topic of using code to analyzie flag design.
